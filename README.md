**The mystery of the baron's daughter (title tbd)**

*Abstract*

The sun was shining brightly on the last day of June along the rugged coast of Rygland. In the quaint town of Brandal, a former but important shipping hub for the copper trade which had dominated the region’s trade for centuries, the Richards family had gathered for their yearly get together. Their history ran deep in the region, but in recent years they had torn up their roots and dispersed throughout the country following what locally had become known as the great drought of 1957. Unlike most droughts, this one had nothing to do with water supply. The region had been stripped and bled dry of every single ounce of copper ore that once harbored in the ancient mountains along the valley. The Richard's had played an important part in the copper industry, but expanded elsewhere after the drought. 

Somewhere higher up in the family, it had been decided to host this years get together on the infamous Slitøya, a small and luscious island about 15 nautical miles off the coast of Brandal. The family had owned this island for generations, but largely abandoned it’s manor house and beautiful landscapes after the great drought. This get together marked the family’s first return to the region for over a decade. For some, this return would evoke strong feelings of nostalgia, for others unpleasant memories, and for some, something much more sinister and murderous would be in store.

You are an old friend of Liz Richard, the oldest daughter of the late Baron Felix Richard and current heir of the family fortune. Although you’ve maintained a friendly correspondence with Liz, you have not seen her for close to 7 years when you both attended Rygland University together. The invite, although kindheartedly accepted, came as a bit of a surprise. In recent years, having grown tired of working the local beat as a cop, you opened a private practice as a detective in the region's capital. You start the game arriving on a train in Brandal.
